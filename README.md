# Shodan Apache Server Monitoring Service

This project creates a system daemon that periodically queries the Shodan API for Apache servers in Washington state, logging the results to a file. The service includes proper signal handling, systemd integration, and runs under a system user.

### Part 1 - service core behaviors

The service:

1. Queries Shodan's API for Apache servers in WA state
2. Writes server IPs and locations to /tmp/shodan_servers.out
3. Runs on a configurable interval (default: 1 hour)

**Main Components:**
* `src/shodan_service.py`: Main service logic
* Uses Python's `requests` library for API calls
* Proper file handling with write/append modes
* Structured JSON response parsing

The file: /tmp/shodan_servers.out

The count: every hour, it should write the current count out to the file.

The output for each second should look roughly like this:  
(City, IP)  
Moses Lake, 2848780134  
Airway Heights, 1132527954  
Seattle, 2161130759  
Aberdeen, 395946120  

### Part 2 - Add signal handling to your program

My program handles SIGTERM, meaning a signal handler runs and tells the process to close the file and stop running.

When my program receives the SIGTERM signal, it needs to write out that it received the signal to the /tmp/shodan_servers.out file, *then* die using an OS exit in Python.

## Part 5 - Showing the shodansvc output via service

Screenshots I took include:
* A complete CI/CD pipeline run with all stages visible
* The build, test, and lint stages.
* Proof that the linter has been run (it does not need to be perfectly clean).
* The final package or product generated by your CI pipeline:
